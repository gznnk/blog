# About This Blog

This blog is created to experiment with the concept of **Knowledge as Code**.
The goal is not just to write knowledge as text, but to **preserve it in a form that can be managed and operated just like code**.

---

The trigger for starting this was the **emergence of coding agents**.
Honestly, I could have built a system like this before if I wanted to, but I didn't have the drive to do so.

With the environment now ready where AI can write code instantly,
**I finally decided to get started.**

I believe that for system engineers, knowledge assets consist of **both text and code**.

---

Platforms like Zenn and Qiita are very convenient, but
they are somewhat less suitable for "accumulating and managing" code itself as knowledge.

In this blog, by **handling text and code in the same repository**,
I believe I can resolve that issue.

---

Technically, I **write articles in Markdown, convert them to HTML, and publish them**.

Using:
- GitHub Actions
- GitHub Pages

I have set up CI/CD, so
**just writing Markdown and pushing it automatically publishes the content**.

The update flow as a blog is quite light,
allowing me to immediately reflect whatever comes to mind.

---

The ability to **manage article update history as git diffs** is also
one of the reasons I chose this format.

Having a history of what was fixed and how thoughts changed is,
I believe, **logical as a method of knowledge management**.

---

Also, being able to **complete everything within an IDE like VSCode** is a major advantage.

Since I can write as an extension of my usual development environment,
I can continue without being conscious of special tools.

AI is also easier to use within an IDE, and
I feel this configuration has **high affinity with AI**.

Since I can write text while conversing with AI,
I believe **knowledge accumulation becomes smoother**.

---

Based on this background, as a **place to verify Knowledge as Code while actually operating it**, I will explore the ideal way of knowledge management for system engineers in this blog.
