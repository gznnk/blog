I built a personal blog using Vibe Coding.

Technically, I'm not doing anything complicated.
I just write articles in Markdown, manage them with Git, convert them to HTML,
and publish them on GitHub Pages.

To be honest,
this configuration itself has been "possible" for a long time.
However, it was tedious, and I didn't feel like making it.

Recently, writing code with AI has become commonplace,
and the cost of such preparation and maintenance has dropped dramatically.

"I can build it quickly now," I thought,
which was the trigger for creating this blog.

## The Concept of Knowledge as Code

This blog is also a place to experiment with the concept of **Knowledge as Code**.

I believe that knowledge assets for system engineers include
not only text but also code, design, and the history of decisions.

By managing it with Git, information such as:

- What was fixed and how
- When thoughts changed
- What was tried and what was abandoned

naturally remains as diffs.

This feels right in that
**knowledge can be treated as something to be nurtured just like code**.

## Feeling a Better Fit in the AI Era

With AI as a premise,
the cost of writing code itself drops significantly.

On the other hand, the importance of **information outside the code**, such as:

- Why this configuration was chosen
- Where compromises were made
- What assumptions were made for decisions

is actually increasing, I feel.

The configuration of Markdown + Git + IDE
works well with AI, making it very easy to organize thoughts through dialogue
and refine content.

The faster implementation becomes with AI,
the more important I feel this place for knowledge becomes.

## About the Technical Configuration

This blog operates with the following configuration:

- Write articles in Markdown
- Manage history with Git
- Build with GitHub Actions
- Publish on GitHub Pages

If I write an article and push it, it is automatically published.
It's quite simple for a blog,
and I like that I can handle it as an extension of my daily development work.

Since it is completed within an IDE like VSCode,
there is no need to be conscious of special tools.

## Changes Since Becoming a Manager

Recently, management has become my main focus,
and conveying my knowledge and know-how to subordinates and team members
has become the center of my work.

When that happens,
I increasingly feel the need to **properly shape and convey**
things I used to do as a matter of course
or decisions I made implicitly in my head.

Not just explaining verbally on the spot, but I wanted to leave content such as:

- Why I think so
- On what premise I am making decisions
- How I organize things, including failed experiences

in a form that can be referred to later.

This blog is also a place
to organize such knowledge and thoughts
and put them into a form that can be passed on to someone.

## "Who I Write For" is Different from Zenn or Qiita

I think Zenn and Qiita are still very good places.
They are optimal for delivering reusable knowledge to an unspecified large number of people.

On the other hand, this blog
is not intended for wide dissemination.

- Myself
- Subordinates and juniors
- People I might work with in the future
- People I want to share my way of thinking with

I position it as a place to convey information, including the background of technology and decisions,
to **someone close to me**.

When dissemination to an unspecified large number of people is the premise,
one tends to lean towards content that interests many people.
However, if it is for someone close,
I believe I can eliminate such distractions and concentrate on what I really want to convey.

## Conclusion

Things that were simple but plainly tedious
and that I had been putting off
have suddenly become realistic thanks to AI.

I intend to operate this blog for a while
as a **practice of Knowledge as Code** in the AI coding era,
and as a place to convey my knowledge and thoughts.

I would be happy if this could be a reference
for those who are similarly worried about
where to put their output or how to convey knowledge.
