## Introduction
In the field of system development, there are many words with broad meanings but ambiguous definitions.

For example:

- User Experience
- Microservices
- Cloud Native
- Observability

All of these are important and should not be denied.
On the other hand, they are also words that cannot be answered immediately when asked, "So what specifically needs to be done to satisfy them?".

These concepts function effectively in the early stages of design and at the entrance of discussions.
Even if the details are not decided,
it is possible to create a state of "facing roughly the same direction".

This structure is not limited to system development.

Looking at organizational activities, similarly ambiguous words are used daily.

- Promote DX
- Enhance organizational strength
- Strengthen competitiveness
- Work with a future-oriented mindset

These are also convenient expressions born for humans to act in groups.
In the exploration stage or situations with high uncertainty,
they function as a lubricant to avoid conflict and not narrow the breadth of thinking.

But the problem is that even when activities progress and
actual actions and results are required,
these words continue to be used without being concretized.

As a result:

- Criteria for judgment are not shared
- The locus of responsibility becomes unclear
- Decisions are pushed downstream

Eventually, it ends in a failure that no one is convinced of.

## Reason Why Natural Language Has Ambiguity

Natural language inherently tolerates ambiguity.

- The problem is not yet defined
- Want to leave diverse interpretations
- Want to abstract complex things
- Want to form a broad common understanding

In the exploration stage, ambiguous words are rational and even necessary.

Ambiguity is not a defect but
**"a function for not deciding yet"**.

## Ambiguity Has a Lifespan

The problem is not ambiguity itself.
It lies in **continuing to hold ambiguity**.

As long as humans act in the real world,
eventually, "decision" and "implementation" must always be performed.

| Phase | Role of Language |
|---|---|
| Exploration | Tolerate ambiguity |
| Organization | Decompose ambiguity |
| Decision | Eliminate ambiguity |
| Implementation | Leave no ambiguity |

A state where ambiguity remains in the implementation phase is
not a design error but a **structural accident**.

## Why People Continue to Use Ambiguous Words

Ambiguous words are convenient for humans.

- Can postpone decisions
- Can avoid investigation and understanding
- Do not have to clarify responsibility

Especially in organizations,
**people in higher positions can use ambiguous words**.

> "Please handle it appropriately"

This single phrase becomes one's own achievement if successful,
and becomes the responsibility of the downstream if it fails.

Even if this is unconscious,
it creates an organizational disease called **dilution of responsibility**.

## Why System Development Cannot Withstand Ambiguity

Software cannot execute ambiguity.

- true / false
- if / else
- type / non-type
- boundary / responsibility

Requirements written ambiguously in natural language
are always concretized somewhere.

And in many cases, that role is
**pushed onto the implementer with the weakest position**.

## Responsibility to "Kill" Ambiguity

What is important is the recognition that:

> **Ambiguity is a resource for exploration,
> not an indulgence to avoid decisions**

In a healthy organization/healthy development:

- Not by increasing words
- Nor by piling up documents
- But by structure, types, and constraints
- Ambiguity is killed at the appropriate timing

This is what is done.

## Conclusion

Continuing to use ambiguous words until the end is
neither flexibility nor thoughtfulness.

It is simply
**a state of turning away from decision and responsibility**.

The courage to allow ambiguity, and
the sincerity to end ambiguity.

Whether one can have both divides
the success or failure of system development and, by extension, organizational activities.
