## Introduction

In the field of system development, words like the following are often used:

- State
- Authority
- Flow
- Approval
- Status

These appear to be neutral, technical, and clear words at first glance.
However, in reality, when asked "what is the definition?" or "how far does it include?", they often become ambiguous immediately.

This phenomenon is not a coincidence.
Rather, it is because **the act of system development itself is established in exchange for ambiguity**.

## Complex Reality Cannot Be Handled As Is

The real world is continuous and full of exceptions.

Human behavior is unpredictable, situations change depending on context, and judgments always waver.
There are almost no "completely defined states" or "clear boundaries" there.

However, systems cannot handle reality as it is.

- Ambiguous things cannot be calculated
- Things without boundaries cannot be branched
- Undefined things cannot be saved

So humans sort reality once.

## What is Bureaucratic Thinking?

The word "bureaucratic" used by Yuval Noah Harari is not merely a metaphor for red tape.

It refers to:

> A mode of thinking to convert complex reality into a manageable world by dropping it into definitions, classifications, and forms

Bureaucracy handles the world as follows:

- Define states
- Divide by whether conditions are met or not
- Separate exceptions as exceptions
- Entrust judgment to forms

As a result, reality becomes a "processable form".

Importantly, **this is not a question of good or evil**.
Bureaucratic thinking is also an essential technology for operating a huge and complex society.

## This Structure is System Development Itself

System development has exactly the same structure.

Users, permissions, states, events, flows.
These are all results of converting the real world into "types" or "models" once.

```ts
status: "draft" | "approved" | "rejected"
```

This definition is clear.
But at the same time, realities like the following are cut off:

- A state of being almost approved
- A state where only a part is exceptionally permitted
- A judgment in the middle of a state transition

**The gradation of reality is replaced by discrete values.**

This is essentially the same as how bureaucracy handles society.

## Why Ambiguity Remains

Here is one important point.

Systems are designed to eliminate ambiguity.
However, in reality, ambiguity does not disappear.

Why?

**Because the model is always incomplete compared to the complexity of reality.**

- Cases that cannot be fully defined appear later
- Unexpected operations begin
- Exceptions become the norm

As a result,
"Words that should be defined" become ambiguous again.

This is very similar to the situation in bureaucracy where:

- There are institutions, but interpretations waver
- There are rules, but they depend on on-site judgment

## When Bureaucracy Fails, Systems Also Fail

The problems of bureaucracy pointed out by Harari overlap directly with examples of system development failures.

- Classifications no longer fit reality
- Forms become the purpose
- Exception handling continues to increase
- Flexible changes become impossible

As a result, a state is born where:

> Reality is changing,
> but only the system is left behind

This is also the essential form of what is called a legacy system.

## Good Design is Not About Eliminating Ambiguity

Here, I want to clear up a misunderstanding about design.

**Good system design is not about completely eliminating ambiguity.**

Rather, it is closer to consciously deciding:

- How far to drop into forms
- From where to leave as ambiguous

Since we cannot completely discard bureaucracy,
the problem shifts to "how to control bureaucratic thinking".

## Conclusion

It is not a coincidence that system development and bureaucracy are similar.
Both are:

> Attempts to somehow make complex and ambiguous reality into a manageable form

Ambiguous words are not born from negligence.
**They are born as a side effect of the world being inherently ambiguous.**

And when that fails,
we may be facing not a design problem,
but a **gap between reality and form**.
